### Welcome

Hey there. How is your day?

My name is Ratpipe, just a normal guy learning how to code.
I hope you have a good day! Happy coding and enjoy your life!

### Who am I?

You can see who am I in my [website.](https://ratpipedev.github.io)

But this is the short version:

My name is Anoki Youssou, also known as Ratpipe! Im a guy who loves writing codes and experimenting around with tech and codes. I started to mess around with VM which stands for Virtual Machine.

And then in the mid-2020 I started to mess around with Windows / MS-DOS Batch Shell Languages. So far, the only masterpiece made from Batch is just a crappy CLI-style simple calculator.

Then later into July 2020 I started to mess around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But later I moved into Python around August 2021.
